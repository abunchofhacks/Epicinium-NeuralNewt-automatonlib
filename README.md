# Epicinium NeuralNewt automaton library

Library and header files for the [Epicinium](https://epicinium.nl) automaton,
which implements Epicinium's game logic to calculate subsequent game states.
Dependency for [Epicinium-NeuralNewt](https://github.com/abunchofhacks/Epicinium-NeuralNewt),
a framework for training neural networks to play Epicinium with evolutionary training techniques.

The rest of Epicinium, including source files for this library, will be open-sourced in the near future.
It will also be coming soon to [Steam](https://epicinium.nl/steam).

Epicinium is being developed by [A Bunch of Hacks](https://abunchofhacks.coop),
a worker cooperative for video game and software development from the Netherlands.
